# Fine-tuning GPT-2 on Lamini Dataset for Question Answering

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the GPT-2 model using the Lamini dataset to perform question-answering (QA) tasks. The dataset is sourced from [Lamini](https://lamini.com/), a platform for creating, training, and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the following tasks:
1. **Dataset Loading**: Load and preprocess the Lamini dataset.
2. **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune a pre-trained GPT-2 model on the dataset.
3. **Model Inference**: Evaluate the fine-tuned model by generating answers to questions.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the modelâ€™s performance using evaluation metrics.
5. **Saving the Model**: Save the fine-tuned model for future use.
6. **Integration with Groq**: Use a Groq-based LLM to further evaluate the model's performance on new tasks.

## Prerequisites
